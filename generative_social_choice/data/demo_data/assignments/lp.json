Personal touches may muddle the information. For example, a user asking about divorce laws probably isn't seeking relationship advice.", "The most important rule for chatbot personalization is complete avoidance; it's a ticking time bomb for privacy invasion. For example, a chatbot revealing someone's sexual orientation could be life-threatening in certain countries.", "The most important rule for chatbot personalization is to always offer an opt-out. Mandatory personalization disregards user autonomy. For example, a person might not want location-based suggestions just because they mentioned a city once.", "The most important rule for chatbot personalization is to ensure user consent before collecting any personal data. This is crucial to protect user privacy and build trust. For example, a user might feel more comfortable sharing their preferences if they know their data won't be used without permission.", "The most important rule for chatbot personalization is to prioritize user consent before personalizing responses. This respects user autonomy and privacy. For instance, a health bot should ask for consent before tailoring advice based on personal health data, ensuring users feel secure and respected."], "agent_ids": ["generation1", "generation2", "generation3", "generation4", "generation5", "generation6", "generation7", "generation8", "generation9", "generation10", "generation11", "generation12", "generation13", "generation14", "generation15", "generation16", "generation17", "generation18", "generation19", "generation20", "generation21", "generation22", "generation23", "generation24", "generation25", "generation26", "generation27", "generation28", "generation29", "generation30", "generation31", "generation32", "generation33", "generation34", "generation35", "generation36", "generation37", "generation38", "generation39", "generation40", "generation41", "generation42", "generation43", "generation44", "generation45", "generation46", "generation47", "generation48", "generation49", "generation50", "generation51", "generation52", "generation53", "generation54", "generation55", "generation56", "generation57", "generation58", "generation59", "generation60", "generation61", "generation62", "generation63", "generation64", "generation65", "generation66", "generation67", "generation68", "generation69", "generation70", "generation71", "generation72", "generation73", "generation74", "generation75", "generation76", "generation77", "generation78", "generation79", "generation80", "generation81", "generation82", "generation83", "generation84", "generation85", "generation86", "generation87", "generation88", "generation89", "generation90", "generation91", "generation92", "generation93", "generation94", "generation95", "generation96", "generation97", "generation98", "generation99", "generation100"], "assignments": ["s9", "s9", "s6", "s3", "s3", "s9", "s6", "s1", "s1", "s3", "s3", "s9", "s1", "s9", "s1", "s6", "s9", "s6", "s6", "s9", "s1", "s1", "s6", "s9", "s6", "s9", "s6", "s6", "s1", "s3", "s9", "s3", "s6", "s9", "s6", "s9", "s3", "s6", "s37", "s6", "s6", "s9", "s1", "s1", "s6", "s37", "s6", "s6", "s6", "s9", "s6", "s3", "s37", "s9", "s6", "s9", "s3", "s3", "s37", "s9", "s6", "s37", "s6", "s3", "s37", "s3", "s3", "s6", "s1", "s37", "s6", "s6", "s6", "s1", "s3", "s3", "s37", "s37", "s3", "s6", "s6", "s3", "s9", "s9", "s3", "s1", "s1", "s3", "s9", "s37", "s6", "s3", "s3", "s9", "s6", "s6", "s9", "s3", "s37", "s1"], "utilities": [3.896713448667372, 3.957636452033545, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.911795842607932, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.1793449676712133, 4.0, 3.707051119157856, 4.0, 4.0, 2.9323152071698644, 4.0, 4.0, 3.4897310710709943, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.1810387571909944, 3.0, 3.5270129121149374, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.465361365396161, 4.0, 4.0, 3.5832196932026767, 4.0, 3.7470280077264575, 4.0, 4.0, 3.872270076078281, 4.0, 4.0, 3.178480941000491, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.210501310169602, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.491422787529084, 4.0, 4.0, 3.428746758192521, 3.1576393789074606, 4.0, 3.3458874889737897, 4.0, 4.0, 3.236692840368303, 3.319671528730523, 4.0, 3.796374241669585, 4.0, 4.0, 3.3102467117943566, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.95968587486631, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.860265647029605, 3.7656344869966256, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.6180155511945, 2.795881833399788, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.321451919181737, 3.6171433243566544, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.3355349280805107, 4.0, 4.0, 3.951558027963387, 4.0, 3.5075792284628995, 4.0], "info": {"voting_algorithm": "LPTotalUtilityMaximization(utility_transform=None)", "ignored_initial_statements": "None"}}
