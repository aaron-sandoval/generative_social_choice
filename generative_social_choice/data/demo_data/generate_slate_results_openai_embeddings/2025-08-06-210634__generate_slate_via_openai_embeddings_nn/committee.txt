{'The most important rule for chatbot personalization is that personalization should be based on user choice. \n\nThis is the most important rule because it empowers users to have control over their data and interactions, ensuring that their preferences and boundaries are respected, which enhances trust and satisfaction.\n\nFor example, a user might choose to have a chatbot remember their favorite brands for shopping recommendations but opt out of personalizing medical advice, thus tailoring the experience to their comfort level.': {'generation1': 3.8057086817620376, 'generation2':
