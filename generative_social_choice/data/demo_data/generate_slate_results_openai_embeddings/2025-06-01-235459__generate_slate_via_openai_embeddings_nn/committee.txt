{'The most important rule for chatbot personalization is that personalization should be based on user choice. \n\nThis is the most important rule because it empowers users to have control over their interactions, ensuring that their preferences and boundaries are respected, which enhances user satisfaction and trust.\n\nFor example, a user might prefer a chatbot to remember their previous interactions for convenience, while another might want a fresh start each time to explore new topics.': {'generation1': 3.897680820234517, 'generation2': 3.75923775057431, 'generation3':
