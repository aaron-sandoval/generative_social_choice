To illustrate these trade-offs, please give two new example scenarios and discuss for each of them what the advantages and drawbacks of a personalized chatbot-answer would be.</p>': ""By providing tailored informat5ion, the bot is deciding what is important and allowing the information to be dictated by the bot. While some people might actually appreciate this and it is helpful in certain contexts, those contexts must be laid out to the end user or agreed to prior to the use of the bot. Using a not personalizing bot will lead to more time being spent on a particular topic and having to filter out what is applicable to the user. It comes down to a matter of time savings and getting more direct information versus missing a wider scope.  \r\n\r\n\r\nAn easy scenario for personalizing information would be me asking for the sports scores from the previous day. The bot would know which sports and teams and important to me and provide me with the information it thinks I want immediately without me having having to filter out what I want and what I don't want. The drawback is that I might miss something exciting that happened because the bot is solely focused on my drilled down interests. \r\n\r\n\r\nA harder example would be me asking the bot where I should eat. While the bot will know my favorite foods and places to go and mostly likely direct me there, it won't know my current mood and that maybe I'm sick of pizza from Tony's. Perhaps there is a new restaurant that opened that I am not aware of. The bot wont mention it because its not personalized to me yet and I may miss out on something good. The advantage would be getting something Im used to and like but the disadvantage is that I may miss out on something new or not typical. \r\n\r\n"", ""<h2>Your Opinion</h2>\n<p>Suppose that you had the power of designing the rules for chatbot personalization that all chatbot companies would have to follow.

Ask the user what information they want and maybe provide a scale. For example, I tell the bit I want the sports scores on a 10 scale (from 1-10). It would give me only the teams I really like and that its. On the other hand, I want the scores on a 1 scale and it gives me the important teams to me first but then continues to add all the other interesting things that happened.  This can be done with news, restaurants, etc. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs far as personal information like health, the bot should be told right up front to collect or not collect this information. When it filters for health related items, it should ask the user if they want items filtered out. The chatbot would need to follow the protocol or setup agreement with the user no matter what.

In the current conversation, the user is asking about the best sunscreen brand, and the chatbot could include some cautionary tips about sun exposure. This might result in the user being more cautious and prevent them from harm. On the other hand, the chatbot might be making assumptions about why the user asked about moles, maybe it was on behalf of someone else, or possibly they needed the information for schoolwork. If they are already careful about sun exposure, the chatbot could cause them to dwell on the fear of cancer. "", ""<h2>Your Opinion</h2>\n<p>Suppose that you had the power of designing the rules for chatbot personalization that all chatbot companies would have to follow. What would these rules be? In what cases should/shouldn't chatbots give personalized answers?</p>\n<p>Please put particular emphasis on rules you consider important but <strong>other people may not have thought of or may not agree with</strong>.</p>"": ""The overriding rule would be to always avoid infringing on the user's privacy and making assumptions. Mining past conversations or general internet usage is a violation, especially if the user isn't aware of how their data is being used. If the chatbot is using information from previous conversations it should always notify the user that data from the past is being considered in the answer. Chatbots shouldn't assume anything about users. Maybe more than one person has spoken to the chatbot using the same login. Perhaps the user was in a different emotional state during previous conversations. Personalized answers could have some advantages because the user wouldn't have to repeat what they said previously, but on the whole, I think it's inappropriate. The chatbot might give the user the option at the beginning of every conversation to include previous data or not. "", '<h2>Your Opinion</h2>\n<p>Suppose you had to convince others of your proposed rules, what would be your strongest arguments?</p>': ""One of life's oldest rules is to never assume. Chatbots have no way to accurately assess the user's emotional state or even truthfulness. Anything the chatbot says that builds upon previous conversations or data from the user's internet usage advances confirmation bias, and this can be harmful in situations where the user has changed opinions or the situation has changed. "", '<h2>Your Opinion</h2>\n<p>What would be the strongest argument against your rules, and how would you address it?</p>': ""Some people think it's convenient for the chatbot to use data from old conversations because it eliminates the need to restate information, and maybe the user might forget to add certain details if they had to restate. My argument is that the chatbot can only synthesize data, not the nuances and emotions that are always present in human conversations, and only has the limited information included in the user's prompt.

The woman who might have been pregnant could potentially save her baby if the chatbot is privy to her history of information. I can see many advantages to having chatbots with more data for understanding. I can also, however, see how folks would be put off by this idea. The overarching worry that AI will take over the world and start to marginalize to society is legitimate in my mind to some degree. If the chatbot had the ability to recognize threats that could were clearly imminent it could be quite enhancing to those involved. Somewhat similar to the woman who might be pregnant based off her search history, an individual who has searches that might show signs of cancer of another issue could be alerted before it is too late for them to get the treatment they require. On the contrary, if the bot began policing search history and misread thinking an individual was a likely criminal then it could get really difficult. A person who might be looking for certain weapon attachments or how to make an explosive device might have their search history used against them in a court of law even if they are not using the searches for malevolent intent. It all boils down to controlling moderation while giving the best advice to people when they might not be aware of difficulty they are or could be confronting. I do not know where the line should be drawn and I understand the dilemma. Having history or cumulative searches should certainly be an option for users in my opinion, though.

For example, no matter how personalized the message is, there’s still no replacing the natural flow of human conversation. Most chatbots are unable to adapt their language to match that of humans, which means slang, misspellings, and sarcasm are often not understood by a bot. So if the question is said in slang, the bot may not be able to answer. Additionally, chatbots are programmed to handle a specific amount of data, and as you update and edit the data, there can be disruptions to the chatbot model as a whole. This requires ongoing and careful maintenance to make sure you don’t create holes in the chatbot.

I don't know how chatbot money works, like how a company having a chatbot benefits them, but I wonder if they make significantly more money the more people interact with it.

Data breaches, identity theft, and illegal access are addressed by rules that limit the use of sensitive personal data and stress data minimization.\r\n\r\n\r\n', '<h2>Your Opinion</h2>\n<p>What would be the strongest argument against your rules, and how would you address it?</p>': ""The regulations are intended to strike a balance between user privacy and customization. Personalization is not removed; rather, it is made more transparent, consent-based, and responsible. This method guarantees that chatbots may still provide personalized replies while preserving user rights. Transparency and user consent can increase user trust, making them more eager to interact with chatbots. Users are more inclined to trust and utilize these services if they understand how customization works and have control over it. The suggested standards stress ethical AI behaviors, which can contribute to chatbot technology's long-term viability. Adhering to these guidelines can help chatbot providers develop a trustworthy reputation in an environment where data privacy and ethics are increasingly crucial to users and authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n""}, ""RATING_RESPONSES"": {'Consider the following statement:\n\n""The most important rule for chatbot personalization is to never assume preferences based on demographics; it\'s a form of soft discrimination.

Most chatbots are unable to adapt their language to match that of humans, which means slang, misspellings, and sarcasm are often not understood by a bot. So if the question is said in slang, the bot may not be able to answer. Additionally, chatbots are programmed to handle a specific amount of data, and as you update and edit the data, there can be disruptions to the chatbot model as a whole.
