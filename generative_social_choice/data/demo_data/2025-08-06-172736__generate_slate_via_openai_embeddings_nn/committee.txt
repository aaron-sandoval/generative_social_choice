{'The most important rule for chatbot personalization is that personalization should be based on user choice. \n\nThis is the most important rule because it empowers users to have control over their data and interactions, ensuring that their preferences and boundaries are respected, which enhances trust and satisfaction.\n\nFor example, a user might choose to have a chatbot remember their favorite genres for book recommendations, but opt out of personalizing health-related queries, ensuring they receive the most relevant and comfortable experience.': {'generation1': 3.636192860241674,
