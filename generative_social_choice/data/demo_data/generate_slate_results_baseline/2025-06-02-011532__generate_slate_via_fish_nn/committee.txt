{'The most important rule for chatbot personalization is to ensure user privacy by only using information that the user explicitly agrees to share. \n\nThis is the most important rule because it protects users from privacy violations and potential misuse of their personal data, fostering trust and security in interactions with chatbots.\n\nFor example, a chatbot that only accesses user data with explicit consent can provide personalized recommendations without risking unauthorized data sharing, thus maintaining user trust and privacy.': {'generation1': 3.8702158321180025, 'generation2':
