{'The most important rule for chatbot personalization is that personalization should be opt-in, not the default.\n\nThis is the most important rule because it respects user autonomy and ensures that users have control over their data and the level of personalization they receive, preventing unwanted influence or bias.\n\nFor example, a user engaging with a health-focused chatbot can choose to opt-in for personalized advice, ensuring they receive relevant health tips without feeling pressured or influenced by default settings.': {'generation1': 3.3100467017129453, 'generation2':
