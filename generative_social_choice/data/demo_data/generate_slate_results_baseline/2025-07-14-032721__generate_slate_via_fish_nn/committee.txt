{'The most important rule for chatbot personalization is that personalization should be opt-in, not the default. \n\nThis is the most important rule because it respects user autonomy and privacy, allowing individuals to choose whether they want personalized interactions, thus preventing unwanted data collection and potential misuse of personal information.\n\nFor example, a user engaging with a health-focused chatbot can choose to opt-in for personalized advice, ensuring they receive relevant health tips while maintaining control over their personal data.': {'generation1':
