{'The most important rule for chatbot personalization is that personalization should be opt-in, not the default. \n\nThis is the most important rule because it respects user autonomy and ensures that users have control over their data and the level of personalization they receive, preventing unwanted influence or bias.\n\nFor example, a user seeking unbiased news updates can choose not to opt-in for personalization, ensuring they receive general, fact-based information without any tailored bias.': {'generation1': 3.2577953401302064, 'generation2': 3.2445434890773903, 'generation3':
