{"The most important rule for chatbot personalization is that users should have the ability to turn personalization on or off at any time.\n\nThis is the most important rule because it ensures user control and consent in how their data is used, protecting privacy and avoiding unwanted or uncomfortable personalized experiences. By allowing users to decide their level of engagement with personalization, it respects individual preferences and aligns with users' comfort zones regarding their personal information.\n\nFor example, a user searching for unbiased news can toggle off personalization to avoid echo chambers, thus receiving a more balanced range of information.": {'generation1': 3.1023600424953863,
