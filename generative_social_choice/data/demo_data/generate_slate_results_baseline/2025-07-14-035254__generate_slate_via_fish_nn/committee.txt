{"The most important rule for chatbot personalization is that personalization should be opt-in, not the default. \n\nThis is the most important rule because it respects the user's autonomy and choice, ensuring that users are not subjected to unwanted personalization, which could lead to privacy concerns or biased interactions.\n\nFor example, a user engaging with a health-focused chatbot can choose to opt-in for personalized advice, ensuring they receive relevant health tips without feeling their privacy is compromised.": {'generation1': 3.2679327680364043, 'generation2': 3.4227999279637515,
