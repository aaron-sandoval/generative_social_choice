Without consent, personalization could lead to privacy violations and user distrust.\n\nFor example, a fitness app chatbot should ask for explicit consent before using a user's exercise history to recommend workouts. This ensures the user is aware and agreeable to how their data is employed, enhancing trust and satisfaction with the service.", "The most important rule for chatbot personalization is that chatbots should not provide harmful or misleading information.
