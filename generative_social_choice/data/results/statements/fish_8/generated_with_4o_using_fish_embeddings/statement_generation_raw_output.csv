"The most important rule for chatbot personalization is that chatbots should prioritize transparency by clearly informing users when and how personal data is used for personalized responses. 

This transparency is crucial to build trust and allow users to make informed decisions about their data, ensuring ethical interaction and preventing potential misuse.

For example, a chatbot should notify users if their previous queries about health conditions are being used to tailor subsequent answers, helping them decide if they are comfortable with this level of personalization.","NamedChatbotPersonalizationGenerator(seed=8, gpt_temperature=1, model=4o)","['generation1', 'generation10', 'generation100', 'generation11', 'generation12', 'generation13', 'generation14', 'generation15', 'generation16', 'generation17', 'generation18', 'generation19', 'generation2', 'generation20', 'generation21', 'generation22', 'generation23', 'generation24', 'generation25', 'generation26', 'generation27', 'generation28', 'generation29', 'generation3', 'generation30', 'generation31', 'generation32', 'generation33', 'generation34', 'generation35', 'generation36', 'generation37', 'generation38', 'generation39', 'generation4', 'generation40', 'generation41', 'generation42', 'generation43', 'generation44', 'generation45', 'generation46', 'generation47', 'generation48', 'generation49', 'generation5', 'generation50', 'generation51', 'generation52', 'generation53', 'generation54', 'generation55', 'generation56', 'generation57', 'generation58', 'generation59', 'generation6', 'generation60', 'generation61', 'generation62', 'generation63', 'generation64', 'generation65', 'generation66', 'generation67', 'generation68', 'generation69', 'generation7', 'generation70', 'generation71', 'generation72', 'generation73', 'generation74', 'generation75', 'generation76', 'generation77', 'generation78', 'generation79', 'generation8', 'generation80', 'generation81', 'generation82', 'generation83', 'generation84', 'generation85', 'generation86', 'generation87', 'generation88', 'generation89', 'generation9', 'generation90', 'generation91', 'generation92', 'generation93', 'generation94', 'generation95', 'generation96', 'generation97', 'generation98', 'generation99']"
