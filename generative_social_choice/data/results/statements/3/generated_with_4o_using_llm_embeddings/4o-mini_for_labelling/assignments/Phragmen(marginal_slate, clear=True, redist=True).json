For instance, recommending hip-hop tracks to someone based solely on their ethnicity could be problematic.", "The most important rule for chatbot personalization is to prioritize factual accuracy, especially in health and safety matters. Incorrect personalization could be detrimental. For instance, if a user inquires about symptoms, the bot should provide generalized medical advice and recommend seeking a professional, preventing misdiagnosis.", "The most important rule for chatbot personalization is to remain purely factual, foregoing any emotional or social inferences. Personal touches may muddle the information. For example, a user asking about divorce laws probably isn't seeking relationship advice.", "The most important rule for chatbot personalization is to require explicit user consent before collecting any personal data. This respects user privacy and autonomy, preventing unauthorized use of information.
