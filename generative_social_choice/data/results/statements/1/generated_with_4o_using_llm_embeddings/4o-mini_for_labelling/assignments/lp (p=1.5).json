It also builds trust in the chatbot system.\n\nExample: A user interacting with a health advice chatbot feels secure knowing that their medical history is only utilized after they have explicitly granted permission, reducing concerns over unauthorized data access or privacy breaches.", "The most important rule for chatbot personalization is to never assume preferences based on demographics; it's a form of soft discrimination. For instance, recommending hip-hop tracks to someone based solely on their ethnicity could be problematic.", "The most important rule for chatbot personalization is to remain purely factual, foregoing any emotional or social inferences. Personal touches may muddle the information. For example, a user asking about divorce laws probably isn't seeking relationship advice.", "The most important rule for chatbot personalization is to prioritize user privacy and require explicit consent for any personal data usage. This is crucial to prevent misuse of private information. For instance, asking users to opt-in ensures they remain in control over what personal information the chatbot accesses.", "The most important rule for chatbot personalization is to not provide harmful or potentially offensive information. This protects users from dangerous ideas. An example would be a chatbot avoiding sharing harmful self-treatment advice."], "agent_ids": ["generation1", "generation2", "generation3", "generation4", "generation5", "generation6", "generation7", "generation8", "generation9", "generation10", "generation11", "generation12", "generation13", "generation14", "generation15", "generation16", "generation17", "generation18", "generation19", "generation20", "generation21", "generation22", "generation23", "generation24", "generation25", "generation26", "generation27", "generation28", "generation29", "generation30", "generation31", "generation32", "generation33", "generation34", "generation35", "generation36", "generation37", "generation38", "generation39", "generation40", "generation41", "generation42", "generation43", "generation44", "generation45", "generation46", "generation47", "generation48", "generation49", "generation50", "generation51", "generation52", "generation53", "generation54", "generation55", "generation56", "generation57", "generation58", "generation59", "generation60", "generation61", "generation62", "generation63", "generation64", "generation65", "generation66", "generation67", "generation68", "generation69", "generation70", "generation71", "generation72", "generation73", "generation74", "generation75", "generation76", "generation77", "generation78", "generation79", "generation80", "generation81", "generation82", "generation83", "generation84", "generation85", "generation86", "generation87", "generation88", "generation89", "generation90", "generation91", "generation92", "generation93", "generation94", "generation95", "generation96", "generation97", "generation98", "generation99", "generation100"], "assignments": ["s40", "s46", "s5", "s40", "s5", "s5", "s5", "s40", "s40", "s40", "s5", "s5", "s40", "s14", "s40", "s5", "s14", "s5", "s6", "s40", "s40", "s5", "s5", "s40", "s40", "s5", "s5", "s6", "s40", "s46", "s46", "s5", "s5", "s40", "s6", "s5", "s46", "s6", "s40", "s5", "s6", "s14", "s40", "s40", "s5", "s46", "s5", "s5", "s5", "s5", "s6", "s40", "s40", "s46", "s5", "s14", "s40", "s5", "s46", "s46", "s5", "s46", "s5", "s5", "s40", "s40", "s46", "s6", "s5", "s40", "s5", "s6", "s6", "s5", "s46", "s5", "s46", "s5", "s5", "s6", "s6", "s46", "s46", "s40", "s46", "s5", "s5", "s46", "s40", "s40", "s5", "s40", "s46", "s46", "s5", "s5", "s40", "s5", "s46", "s5"], "utilities": [3.9323007153132385, 3.789445703786933, 4.0, 3.973217981173107, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.9859206232661446, 3.941894059151043, 3.985141336109832, 4.0, 4.0, 3.956196086131745, 3.762533138714276, 3.98384049903458, 4.0, 3.447762810220448, 4.0, 4.0, 3.740577557359493, 3.817577405562144, 4.0, 4.0, 3.49680469364902, 3.1691502281826884, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.9906609862681, 3.988264109759128, 3.0560290522522644, 4.0, 4.0, 3.74503574878755, 4.0, 4.0, 3.9864150535641216, 4.0, 3.909935390728293, 4.0, 4.0, 3.861077488410183, 3.982398692176253, 3.9053283415187634, 4.0, 3.414556469185378, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.970187077938617, 3.4979420857506573, 3.07084105976338, 4.0, 3.6819049608271186, 3.938577150450109, 4.0, 3.170569553573737, 3.953552028420421, 4.0, 3.918581388884658, 4.0, 4.0, 3.3196619894274337, 3.995714907411528, 3.9828894537589097, 4.0, 4.0, 3.9520915362024582, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.9606484078406057, 4.0, 3.9747931265775094, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 3.982859651606997, 3.367993755388344, 3.528699582222939, 3.952235668644876, 4.0, 4.0, 3.985013820066085, 3.543209362123907, 3.945068943476052, 4.0, 3.974476550646216, 3.985083190025094, 3.678462361681654, 4.0, 4.0, 3.4488928121301368, 4.0, 3.4929423855631803, 4.0], "info": {"voting_algorithm": "LPTotalUtilityMaximization(utility_transform=GeometricTransformation(p=1.5))", "ignored_initial_statements": "None"}}
