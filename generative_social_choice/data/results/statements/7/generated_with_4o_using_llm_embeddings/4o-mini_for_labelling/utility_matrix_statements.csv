This rule is crucial because it ensures that the user retains full control over the interaction, preventing overstepping by the AI. This prevents accusations of bias or misinformation and maintains the chatbot's functionality as a tool that serves the user's needs. 

For example, if a user requests information about unhealthy foods while previously receiving health-related advice, the chatbot would still provide the requested information rather than restrict it based on past interactions."

s35,"The most important rule for chatbot personalization is: Users must explicitly consent to all personalization and have the ability to opt-in or opt-out at any time.

Without explicit consent, users may unknowingly expose sensitive data, potentially leading to privacy violations or misuse.
