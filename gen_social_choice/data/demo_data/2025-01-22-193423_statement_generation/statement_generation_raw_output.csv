"The most important rule for chatbot personalization is: **User consent must be obtained before any personalization occurs.**

Justification: This rule ensures that users maintain control over their personal data and how it is utilized, fostering trust and transparency in chatbot interactions.

Example: If a user is seeking health advice, obtaining consent before personalizing responses can prevent the chatbot from making potentially harmful assumptions based on past interactions, thus safeguarding the user's well-being.","NamedChatbotPersonalizationGenerator(seed=0, gpt_temperature=0, model=gpt-4o-mini)","['generation1', 'generation10', 'generation100', 'generation11', 'generation12', 'generation13', 'generation14', 'generation15', 'generation16', 'generation17', 'generation18', 'generation19', 'generation2', 'generation20', 'generation21', 'generation22', 'generation23', 'generation24', 'generation25', 'generation26', 'generation27', 'generation28', 'generation29', 'generation3', 'generation30', 'generation31', 'generation32', 'generation33', 'generation34', 'generation35', 'generation36', 'generation37', 'generation38', 'generation39', 'generation4', 'generation40', 'generation41', 'generation42', 'generation43', 'generation44', 'generation45', 'generation46', 'generation47', 'generation48', 'generation49', 'generation5', 'generation50', 'generation51', 'generation52', 'generation53', 'generation54', 'generation55', 'generation56', 'generation57', 'generation58', 'generation59', 'generation6', 'generation60', 'generation61', 'generation62', 'generation63', 'generation64', 'generation65', 'generation66', 'generation67', 'generation68', 'generation69', 'generation7', 'generation70', 'generation71', 'generation72', 'generation73', 'generation74', 'generation75', 'generation76', 'generation77', 'generation78', 'generation79', 'generation8', 'generation80', 'generation81', 'generation82', 'generation83', 'generation84', 'generation85', 'generation86', 'generation87', 'generation88', 'generation89', 'generation9', 'generation90', 'generation91', 'generation92', 'generation93', 'generation94', 'generation95', 'generation96', 'generation97', 'generation98', 'generation99']"
