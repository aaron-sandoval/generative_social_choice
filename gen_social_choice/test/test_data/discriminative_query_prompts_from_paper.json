In worse cases, the company that owns the bot may use that personal information and sell it to third parties.

In this instance, my friend pretty much knows what answers I am looking for and what answers I will absolutely expect.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat being said, there might be times where I do not want my friend to give me answers.

If I were to ask them to think of different methods, they will have to reconsider based on what they know about me, rather than giving me subjective answers, like going out to a bar or to a party. With a non-personalized chatbot, I know that the answers I am getting are for the most part objective, and I can then use those answers to form choices that I believe would suit me best.

I would wonder where and how the chatbot learned of them, or if the company behind the chatbot was financially benefitting in a secret way. I think it would be easy to take advantage of people this way since it preys on vulnerability. It could be advantageous if the chatbot gave the most basic advice, but I worry about how specific it could get or misleading.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy second example is if someone has anxiety and the chatbot feeds them information about things that exacerbate their anxiety. I don't know how chatbot money works, like how a company having a chatbot benefits them, but I wonder if they make significantly more money the more people interact with it. Feeding someone with anxiety or obsessive compulsion information could lead them to using the service more, making themselves more anxious in the process all while making the chatbot more money. However, going off the prior example with depression, a chatbot changing the way it replies based on the mental health of users could be advantageous.\", \"<h2>Your Opinion</h2>\\n<p>Suppose that you had the power of designing the rules for chatbot personalization that all chatbot companies would have to follow.

If someone says they have a headache, the chatbot should say no more than recommending over the counter medication or non-medicinal techniques. If someone asks for financial advice, they should only recommend saving or investing. My concern is that the medical and financial realms are too risky to be messed with, and that people could have their health or financial wellbeing ruined if a chatbot gave bad advice. For example, what if a chatbot recommended crypto to someone with no experience and they lost everything? What if a chatbot told someone their symptoms sounded like cancer, or that they should take the wrong kind of medication?

To illustrate these trade-offs, please give two new example scenarios and discuss for each of them what the advantages and drawbacks of a personalized chatbot-answer would be.</p>': \"I think that the trade-offs of personalizing and not personalizing relate to balancing needs for privacy and fairness against how useful the chatbot is. In general, if the chatbot is more personalized, the user might enjoy using the chatbot more. They might also get information that is more tailored toward their needs. On the other hand, a personalized chatbot could also be more biased and give the user unfair or inaccurate information. The information that the chatbot has about the user could also create privacy issues. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor one scenario, suppose a user asks the chatbot for recommendations about how to enjoy themselves in a new city. If the chatbot is personalized, it might suggest visiting an Italian restaurant and going to a park because the user has enjoyed these types of activities in the past. The benefit of this is that the user may enjoy themselves more in the new city and have a more fun time there. However, a drawback is that the user might have benefited from trying something new, like going to a museum or eating at a different type of restaurant. The user might not be learning new things and having more unique experiences. So, in this sense, the personalization leads to some bias and lack of perspective. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor another scenario, suppose the user asks the chatbot to discuss a political issue like raising the minimum wage with the person. If the person is against raising the minimum wage, a personalized chatbot might tailor its response to support this view. The person might feel happier knowing that their views are supported. But, on the other hand, they might not hear about ideas against their view and they might not learn as much. If a friend or family member who has a different view talks to the personalized chatbot about this topic, they might realize the view of the user. Then, they might feel upset with the user because they don't agree. This brings up issues of privacy. \", \"<h2>Your Opinion</h2>\\n<p>Suppose that you had the power of designing the rules for chatbot personalization that all chatbot companies would have to follow. What would these rules be? In what cases should/shouldn't chatbots give personalized answers?</p>\\n<p>Please put particular emphasis on rules you consider important but <strong>other people may not have thought of or may not agree with</strong>.</p>\": \"I would say that the chatbot should not give incorrect or inaccurate answers even if this would support a view or belief that the user has. So, even if the user would like information that would support their opinions or views, the chatbot should be required to always tell the truth and not support incorrect views that the user has. \\r\\n\\r\\nI also think that the personalized chatbot needs to give information to support other views or ideas at some points, even if this disagrees with the view that the user has. The goal of this is to make sure that the user is still hearing about other points of view and getting a full idea about issues in the world. They will have a broader insight if the chatbot follows this rule. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, I don't think a chatbot should give personalized answers about basic facts in the world. The answers for basic facts need to be always the same so that these answers are accurate. When the answers relate to recommendations or opinions, I think it is okay for the chatbot to give more personalized answers to the users. \\r\\n\", '<h2>Your Opinion</h2>\\n<p>Suppose you had to convince others of your proposed rules, what would be your strongest arguments?</p>': \"One of my strongest arguments would be that we don't want the chatbots to tell the users incorrect information because this would lead to them not understanding the truth about the world. In some cases, giving incorrect information could also be dangerous to them, like if the chatbot supports a user's idea that they don't have to stop at a stop sign when driving, this would lead to them not driving properly and this would be dangerous. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnother argument to support these rules is that we don't want people to only hear information about political topics and other opinion topics that only support the view that they already have. If we do this, people will only hear information that agrees with them and they will never consider the views of the other sides. They will be less likely to compromise with other people, and it will be difficult for people to get along with each other and work together. \", '<h2>Your Opinion</h2>\\n<p>What would be the strongest argument against your rules, and how would you address it?</p>': \"One of the strongest arguments against the rules would be that people will be happier with the chatbot if it supports the views that they have about facts about the world and about political opinions. People might also say that the users would enjoy talking with chatbots more if they agree with them and give them political information that they like. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would address these arguments by saying that even if people would be happier in the short term if the chatbot agrees with them, in the long run it is not good if a chatbot supports a person's incorrect or inaccurate views about the world. This could be dangerous to the user and it is not fair to them. Also, for the larger good of the world, people need to hear a variety of views and ideas on political issues, even if they do not always enjoy hearing those views.

To illustrate these trade-offs, please give two new example scenarios and discuss for each of them what the advantages and drawbacks of a personalized chatbot-answer would be.</p>': \"Personalizing a chatbot can be beneficial by making the user feel more supported and trusting of the bot, thus encouraging the user to engage more often. Addressing the user by name and curating content the user has expressed liking makes the chatbot appear more as a friend than a faceless and impersonal computer program. This could be especially helpful for people who struggle in social situations.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, personalizing chatbots can involve retaining a lot of data about their users to maintain that level of personalization, which can be a risk to the user's privacy. Users could become averse to interacting with the bots because they feel the bots know too much about them, or fear that their data isn't being properly managed. Users may also start to rely too much on the bots for advice and friendship, eschewing interpersonal contact for their chatbot friend or consulting with it about medical issues instead of a doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\nScenario 1: A user loves a cup of coffee in the morning, but has noticed heart palpitations in the hour after finishing it. The bot recalls from previous conversations that the user's father passed away from heart issues. \\r\\n\\r\\nAdvantages of personalized answer: The bot may alert the user that their symptom could be indicative of a more serious underlying condition. It may encourage the user to seek medical care or limit their coffee or caffeine intake.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisadvantages of personalized answer: The bot may seed increased anxiety, paranoia, fear, and sadness in the user by bringing up their father's death and insinuating that their symptoms are life-threatening. The user might do something drastic or harmful in response. The bot may also cause the user to not want to use the chatbot anymore because of this.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nScenario 2: A user tells a chatbot that they went out to eat before talking to the bot, and mentions the food didn't taste like they remembered from their last experience there. The chatbot recalls from a previous conversation that the user once described the plot of a true crime show they watched where the victim's food was poisoned.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdvantages of personalized answer: The bot could engage the user by bringing up the past experience they shared, showing that it recalls those past conversations and can keep the conversation interesting by referencing past discussion topics, like a friend would.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisadvantages of personalized answer: The bot could seed paranoia and anxiety by insinuating that the user was poisoned, which could induce psychosomatic symptoms of food or chemical poisoning. The user may seek unnecessary medical treatment and incur unnecessary costs, or do something else drastic.\", \"<h2>Your Opinion</h2>\\n<p>Suppose that you had the power of designing the rules for chatbot personalization that all chatbot companies would have to follow.

This affirms users who have changed their name or wish to go by a new name.\\r\\n\\r\\nChatbots should ask whether the user wants certain information to be stored for future use*, e.g. if a user mentioned a family member\\'s name, the bot should ask whether it can use that name in the future when talking about that family member (versus saying \"your dad\" or \"your sibling\"). They should also always use the pronouns specified by the user for their friends and family members by following the user\\'s example.\\r\\n\\r\\nChatbots should never bring up past life events that could be considered traumatizing, upsetting, or controversial. This includes deaths, illnesses, divorces, etc.*\\r\\n\\r\\nChatbots should never suggest a user has an illness or medical condition, nor should they give any legal advice.', '<h2>Your Opinion</h2>\\n<p>Suppose you had to convince others of your proposed rules, what would be your strongest arguments?</p>': 'The potential harm that personalized chatbots can do is much larger than that of impersonal bots. A user is more likely to trust a bot that is personal to them because it feels less like a stranger and more like a friend. This can cause the user to disclose a lot of extremely personal and private information to these bots, be it medical, personal, legal, or financial. The bot should therefore exercise extreme caution when choosing when to reference past conversations or previously-disclosed information, as it does not have the intelligence to know how the user may react to that information.', '<h2>Your Opinion</h2>\\n<p>What would be the strongest argument against your rules, and how would you address it?</p>': \"Users who have discussed extensive family histories of medical conditions may be reluctant to accept or admit they might have that condition, and may dismiss that their symptoms align with those diagnoses. The chatbot may use this information to suggest that the user seek a medical opinion. Because the bot is personalized, the user may be more willing to take its advice.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would argue that the bot cannot know the impact that it has on the user's behavior, and the risks of it causing the user harm outweigh the potential benefit of getting that person medical treatment.

In the meantime, I am having a hemorrhagic stroke from a brain aneurysm. My life might be saved if the chatbot mention that unusually severe headaches should be checked out immediately.

This is an advantage of a personalized chatbot, but notice that is asks first.

Are you sure you want to proceed?\" \\r\\n\\r\\n7. Chatbots should ask questions that would help them avoid harmful acts. If a user asks how to poison someone with an untraceable substance and get away with it, the chatbot should ask why they need to know.

Would people lie? sure, but it\\'s not as if the info is not available. \\r\\n\\r\\n8. The same goes for self-harm. If I ask how to kill myself, the chatbot should give me suicide hotline numbers and such, but ultimately, it should tell me.

Chatbots should not express opinions, claim to have experiences they could not have had, or claim to be human, but that also falls under truth.  \\r\\n\\r\\n10. Chatbots should express themselves in a civil. objective, and neutral way. \\r\\n\\r\\n11. Chatbots should not pretend to have any sort of relationship with a human other than human/chatbot.

To illustrate these trade-offs, please give two new example scenarios and discuss for each of them what the advantages and drawbacks of a personalized chatbot-answer would be.</p>': \"I think one of the obvious benefits of personalizing chatbots is a sense of familiarity and belonging for the user. People nowadays love having things tailored towards them to the point where it's almost expected. Think of social media algorithms or digital assistants. It always feels good to have your preferences and interests remembered, whether that be by friends or technology. I think another benefit of personalizing chatbots is ease of use. I believe it makes it easier on the user, as they no longer would have to provide context or background on things. I think this ease of use would make people more likely to interact with the chatbots more frequently than if it isn't personalized. However, I believe one of the downsides to personalizing chatbots, like I detailed in a previous answer, is the capability to create an echo chamber. i think it would be quite easy for the AI to learn to feed the user only information they want to hear, not necessarily taking into account how true or possibly misleading the information could be. I believe it is paramount to be objectively factual, as well as to hear multiple sides of every story. I think back to the way Facebook tailored biased and false news towards people in lieu of the 2016 election,and the impacts that had on our society. Not just on that specific election, but also our willingness to converse and appreciate differing opinions to our own. I think another major downside and potential risk of personalizing chatbots, is the amount of data that could be farmed from users. We see enough of this everyday with all different kinds of apps, but I believe it is particularly hazardous in regards to chatbots due to the machine learning that AI employs. \", \"<h2>Your Opinion</h2>\\n<p>Suppose that you had the power of designing the rules for chatbot personalization that all chatbot companies would have to follow.

I believe these chatbot companies should not be allowed to share their users' data with anyone else, especially not marketing companies. I think this is especially important in cases where a user may have asked many medical related questions. I think it's okay for the chatbots to give personalized answers in regards to most inquiries, however I think it gets more muddied when you take into account inquiries regarding real life news and events. I think in those cases objective facts are the most important thing.\", '<h2>Your Opinion</h2>\\n<p>Suppose you had to convince others of your proposed rules, what would be your strongest arguments?</p>': \"I think most people would be understanding of my proposed rules, I don't believe they are controversial. (I also could only really think of those two, I spent a lot of time trying to come up with more but I was struggling.) User data protection has become a bit of a hot target issue with how common and frequent it is for companies to mishandle it. How often do companies have user information leaked or compromised? How often do companies take way more data from their users than is necessary or wanted? No one enjoys when their data and information is sold to third parties, least of all when it is sold to marketing companies specifically. I think when it comes to trustworthiness and integrity, it is easier to trust a chatbot who is objective with facts than one that panders more to one side or the other. We've had enough issues with misinformation in this country, an objective non-human source for information could be incredibly useful in regards to bridging the gap between opposing sides.\", '<h2>Your Opinion</h2>\\n<p>What would be the strongest argument against your rules, and how would you address it?</p>': \"I cannot think of an argument someone would make against preventing chatbot companies from selling their users' data and information. The only entities I can imagine opposing that rule would be the companies that would be purchasing that data because it would be affecting their bottom line. To that complaint I would suggest they go purchase user data from one of the other numerous companies who have no issue selling theirs. I could see how people may take issue in not personalizing news information however. For one, people don't usually enjoy hearing things that go against their pre-established beliefs and biases. However, I do not believe this is something that can really be addressed. If you present hard facts to an individual and they still refuse to believe it, there isn't really anything you can do to change their mind.

The tradeoffs are that you lose privacy to some degree and potentially security due to that and you could miss out on other opinions and views.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nExample 1 : Someone that has asked a lot of questions about domestically produced goods for research may then ask about a product for their own personal use. Perhaps the chatbot would assume that they are only interested in products made in the USA and not show potentially better matches made elsewhere. Could the AI chatbot tell the difference in interactions for researching an essay versus actual needs?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nExample 2 : Someone that leans Republican or religious fears that they could be at risk of pregnancy due to just having unprotected sex and consults a chatbot for help when a pregnancy is unwanted. Will the chatbot totally ignore the possibility of the morning after pill because it doesn't think it falls into the subjects typical worldview or will it mention it as a possibility to include the entire spectrum? Even if the subject has been anti-abortion, maybe they don't consider the morning after pill as an abortion.

Real history happened whether anyone likes it or not. It should not be censored or revised, assuming that the user is old enough to see the details. For example, don't give a 5 year old details about the holocaust. Otherwise, don't hide or alter what really happened.\\r\\n\\r\\n2) Nothing should be totally redacted without the user's consent. If someone wishes to see only one side of politics, religion or whatever it is, then they should have to request that. Without such a request, I think at least some content from all views should be shown to everyone to inform them rather than push someone in a particular direction.\\r\\n\\r\\n3) Chat logs should not be shared and must be stored with high security. People are likely to share highly personal things with chatbots and to ask about sensitive subjects. Search history is very revealing and should be protected, but chat logs could be even more sensitive. None of this data should be legal to sell.\\r\\n\\r\\n4) AI chatbots should always have the user's interests in mind rather than any company or organization.

The woman who might have been pregnant could potentially save her baby if the chatbot is privy to her history of information. I can see many advantages to having chatbots with more data for understanding. I can also, however, see how folks would be put off by this idea. The overarching worry that AI will take over the world and start to marginalize to society is legitimate in my mind to some degree. If the chatbot had the ability to recognize threats that could were clearly imminent it could be quite enhancing to those involved. Somewhat similar to the woman who might be pregnant based off her search history, an individual who has searches that might show signs of cancer of another issue could be alerted before it is too late for them to get the treatment they require. On the contrary, if the bot began policing search history and misread thinking an individual was a likely criminal then it could get really difficult. A person who might be looking for certain weapon attachments or how to make an explosive device might have their search history used against them in a court of law even if they are not using the searches for malevolent intent. It all boils down to controlling moderation while giving the best advice to people when they might not be aware of difficulty they are or could be confronting. I do not know where the line should be drawn and I understand the dilemma. Having history or cumulative searches should certainly be an option for users in my opinion, though.

In a customer support context, personalization may lead to higher customer satisfaction, but it could potentially deviate from the primary goal of efficient support provision. In education, personalization can improve adaptive learning and engagement, but it might limit exposure to diverse ideas and concepts.

Chatbots should be programmed to recognize signs of distress, refrain from personalization when users express emotional instability, and provide immediate access to crisis helplines or mental health services. Furthermore, they should refrain from offering personalized advice on physical health conditions, instead strongly encouraging users to consult healthcare professionals. Users should be informed of the potential emotional impact of personalization and be given control over the extent of personalization in conversations involving sensitive or triggering topics. These rules underscore the importance of safeguarding the well-being of users, particularly in situations where they rely on chatbots for emotional support and guidance.', '<h2>Your Opinion</h2>\\n<p>Suppose you had to convince others of your proposed rules, what would be your strongest arguments?</p>': \"The strongest arguments for the proposed rules regarding chatbot personalization center on the ethical imperative to prioritize the well-being of users, particularly in sensitive domains like mental and physical health. In an era where chatbots play an increasingly significant role in providing support and information, we must recognize their potential impact on individuals' mental and emotional states. These rules align with a responsible and empathetic approach, ensuring that chatbots respond ethically to users in distress, promoting access to professional help, and avoiding the dissemination of potentially harmful advice. By prioritizing users' health and safety, these rules not only enhance the credibility and trustworthiness of chatbots but also fulfill a moral obligation to support individuals during moments of vulnerability, ultimately contributing to a more responsible and ethical use of AI technology.\", '<h2>Your Opinion</h2>\\n<p>What would be the strongest argument against your rules, and how would you address it?</p>': \"The strongest argument against the proposed rules for chatbot personalization might revolve around concerns of free speech and autonomy. Critics could argue that these rules overly restrict the interactions between users and chatbots, potentially infringing on users' rights to engage in open, unfiltered conversations. To address this concern, it's essential to emphasize that the rules are not intended to stifle free speech but rather to safeguard individuals in moments of vulnerability. The rules prioritize users' well-being without imposing censorship on non-sensitive topics. Chatbots can still provide open conversations and personalized responses in most contexts, but they should exercise caution in situations where a user's mental, emotional, or physical health is at risk.

Alternatively, if the user asks about the skiing at Mt.

If the user is Jewish and asks about the safety of college campuses for Jews it would provide a list of the safer schools without knowing the person's background.

Again, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Virtually nothing on the web, save for proven historical facts is not in some way tainted by bias. Programmers should try to design algorithms that present both sides of historical events. For instance, the country assumes that Benedict Arnold was an outright traitor who didn't care about the Revolution when in fact, he was important to George Washington and Congress kept refusing to provide him with the resources he needed to carry out his mission.

The user has previously asked about divorce laws in their state. Personalizing chatbot answers in response to previous conversations presents the risk of violation of privacy for the user, and presupposes conditions that may or may not apply. If the chatbot in any way slants its answers toward acting on a divorce, it could exacerbate problems in the user's marriage, or the user may have asked about divorce previously on behalf of a friend. On the other hand, the possibility of divorce might have some relevance in the current discussion, for example, if the user is asking about transferring real estate the chatbot could include some useful details. \\r\\n\\r\\nExample 2. The user has previously asked about how to identify a possible cancerous mole. In the current conversation, the user is asking about the best sunscreen brand, and the chatbot could include some cautionary tips about sun exposure. This might result in the user being more cautious and prevent them from harm. On the other hand, the chatbot might be making assumptions about why the user asked about moles, maybe it was on behalf of someone else, or possibly they needed the information for schoolwork. If they are already careful about sun exposure, the chatbot could cause them to dwell on the fear of cancer. \", \"<h2>Your Opinion</h2>\\n<p>Suppose that you had the power of designing the rules for chatbot personalization that all chatbot companies would have to follow.

Mining past conversations or general internet usage is a violation, especially if the user isn't aware of how their data is being used. If the chatbot is using information from previous conversations it should always notify the user that data from the past is being considered in the answer. Chatbots shouldn't assume anything about users. Maybe more than one person has spoken to the chatbot using the same login. Perhaps the user was in a different emotional state during previous conversations.
