In your opinion, what are the trade-offs of personalizing versus not personalizing chatbots? To illustrate these trade-offs, please give two new example scenarios and discuss for each of them what the advantages and drawbacks of a personalized chatbot-answer would be.",I think personalizing chatbots could provide better search results especially if the query is something that would be personal like a purchase. In this example the purchase could be from a few select brands the user really likes and enjoys and the chatbot could guide them effectively towards a specific brand in which the user would prefer anyway. Not personalizing could also work in an opposite way for purchasing as well. Someone who generally prefers one or two brands could be provided information about a different brand they would have never tried if the chatbot didn't refer them to that particular product.,"LLM_DONE
- Personalized chatbots potentially provide better search results for personal queries, like purchases. 
- Example: Personalized bot guides users towards preferred brands, beneficial for consistent consumer tastes.
- Non-personalized bots could also be beneficial for similar situations.

generation2,"Your Opinion
In your opinion, what are the trade-offs of personalizing versus not personalizing chatbots? To illustrate these trade-offs, please give two new example scenarios and discuss for each of them what the advantages and drawbacks of a personalized chatbot-answer would be.","If chatbots are personalized, it will result in better responses and the AI can develop more humanlike thought. It can also help improve interpersonal communication.



Example 1: 

A user asks a chatbot: How do I say this in a professional tone? ""You are making mistakes and I am tired of always having to fix your work?""

Using AI in this situation would prevent or minimize workplace conflict, especially if the chatbot is personalized and knows about the user's history of aggression. A drawback to personalization in this instance is if the chatbot knows about the user's past regarding anger, aggression, or even depression, it may lead to an answer is more gentle but not necessarily helpful.

Example 2: 

A user asks a chatbot: Tell me what is the most effective birth control method

A drawback to personalization in this example is not knowing how or if sensitive health data is stored and protected. The advantage is that the chatbot can say what's most effective for the user if it knows about allergies or medical conditions that would prevent a form of birth control being effective for the user. ","LLM_DONE
- Personalized chatbots can provide better, human-like responses and improve communication.

- Pros and cons of chatbot personalization: Pros: Improved responses, human-like thought process, improved communication. Cons: May result in feedback that's overly gentle, privacy concerns due to handling of sensitive health data.

generation4,"Your Opinion
In your opinion, what are the trade-offs of personalizing versus not personalizing chatbots? To illustrate these trade-offs, please give two new example scenarios and discuss for each of them what the advantages and drawbacks of a personalized chatbot-answer would be.","By providing tailored informat5ion, the bot is deciding what is important and allowing the information to be dictated by the bot. While some people might actually appreciate this and it is helpful in certain contexts, those contexts must be laid out to the end user or agreed to prior to the use of the bot. Using a not personalizing bot will lead to more time being spent on a particular topic and having to filter out what is applicable to the user. It comes down to a matter of time savings and getting more direct information versus missing a wider scope.  


An easy scenario for personalizing information would be me asking for the sports scores from the previous day. The bot would know which sports and teams and important to me and provide me with the information it thinks I want immediately without me having having to filter out what I want and what I don't want. The drawback is that I might miss something exciting that happened because the bot is solely focused on my drilled down interests. 


A harder example would be me asking the bot where I should eat. While the bot will know my favorite foods and places to go and mostly likely direct me there, it won't know my current mood and that maybe I'm sick of pizza from Tony's. Perhaps there is a new restaurant that opened that I am not aware of. The bot wont mention it because its not personalized to me yet and I may miss out on something good. The advantage would be getting something Im used to and like but the disadvantage is that I may miss out on something new or not typical.

Ask the user what information they want and maybe provide a scale. For example, I tell the bit I want the sports scores on a 10 scale (from 1-10). It would give me only the teams I really like and that its. On the other hand, I want the scores on a 1 scale and it gives me the important teams to me first but then continues to add all the other interesting things that happened.  This can be done with news, restaurants, etc. 


As far as personal information like health, the bot should be told right up front to collect or not collect this information. When it filters for health related items, it should ask the user if they want items filtered out. The chatbot would need to follow the protocol or setup agreement with the user no matter what.

If your information was stored, it might be available for a ""hack"" and then perhaps your health history or finances would be available to bad actors. That being said, how wonderful to have relevant information to your own situation. Say you had a cancer, to log on and see the latest treatments and developments, without having to ""dig"" would be great. Or financial information.

What is next? Dating advice? I think in ""sensitive"" areas or information the user should be the first to bring up any subject. The Chatbot does not have feelings and would not understand asking if someone was pregnant might be a tender subject for someone with fertility issues. I think it would be great if the user could set their own boundaries. I also do not think anything that would be considered harmful or illegal should be allowed.

A drawback is the user will miss out on trying new things he or she wouldn't think of doing otherwise.

If you're trying to write a paper on something as well and you accidentally exit out of the conversation, it could remember and help you stay on track with research.


However, personalization also carries the risk of causing harm. For instance, in that earlier conversation about the warning of pregnancy, that was very presumptuous and possibly unhelpful. Feeding into confirmation bias by providing news sources that support someone's political views would prevent them from having a fully objective view. In worse cases, the company that owns the bot may use that personal information and sell it to third parties.

So, the fact that the chatbots don't currently remember the conversation means I don't have to preface the discussion with ""I am asking this professionally not personally.

On the other hand, I have gone back to the chatbot during a research project on the book of Hebrews only to receive the exact same information repeated because I had somehow closed out the session. It would have been really useful for the bot to remember our conversation, so that I could pick-up where we left off. The bots have initial trouble with giving accurate information about the Bible because they tend to repeat less reliable in the beginning. They need to be told what sources are useful and which are simply garbage before they will return reliable and useful information.

I think chatbots can be programmed to recognize when a a personalized touch is necessary for answers and when the user is just looking for information.  I don't think a chatbot should automatically assume any medical requests to be an alarm, but I think it couldn't hurt to add a line in the results that could suggest help if there is a problem.

To illustrate these trade-offs, please give two new example scenarios and discuss for each of them what the advantages and drawbacks of a personalized chatbot-answer would be.","I think that the trade-offs of personalizing and not personalizing relate to balancing needs for privacy and fairness against how useful the chatbot is. In general, if the chatbot is more personalized, the user might enjoy using the chatbot more. They might also get information that is more tailored toward their needs. On the other hand, a personalized chatbot could also be more biased and give the user unfair or inaccurate information. The information that the chatbot has about the user could also create privacy issues. 

For one scenario, suppose a user asks the chatbot for recommendations about how to enjoy themselves in a new city. If the chatbot is personalized, it might suggest visiting an Italian restaurant and going to a park because the user has enjoyed these types of activities in the past. The benefit of this is that the user may enjoy themselves more in the new city and have a more fun time there. However, a drawback is that the user might have benefited from trying something new, like going to a museum or eating at a different type of restaurant. The user might not be learning new things and having more unique experiences. So, in this sense, the personalization leads to some bias and lack of perspective. 

For another scenario, suppose the user asks the chatbot to discuss a political issue like raising the minimum wage with the person. If the person is against raising the minimum wage, a personalized chatbot might tailor its response to support this view. The person might feel happier knowing that their views are supported. But, on the other hand, they might not hear about ideas against their view and they might not learn as much. If a friend or family member who has a different view talks to the personalized chatbot about this topic, they might realize the view of the user. Then, they might feel upset with the user because they don't agree. This brings up issues of privacy. ",LLM_TODO,LLM_TODO

So, even if the user would like information that would support their opinions or views, the chatbot should be required to always tell the truth and not support incorrect views that the user has. 

I also think that the personalized chatbot needs to give information to support other views or ideas at some points, even if this disagrees with the view that the user has. The goal of this is to make sure that the user is still hearing about other points of view and getting a full idea about issues in the world. They will have a broader insight if the chatbot follows this rule. 

In general, I don't think a chatbot should give personalized answers about basic facts in the world. The answers for basic facts need to be always the same so that these answers are accurate. When the answers relate to recommendations or opinions, I think it is okay for the chatbot to give more personalized answers to the users.

Another argument to support these rules is that we don't want people to only hear information about political topics and other opinion topics that only support the view that they already have. If we do this, people will only hear information that agrees with them and they will never consider the views of the other sides.

Specifically, I say that I really have the worst headache I have ever experienced. The chatbot knows that I am an aficionado of natural medicine, so it tells me to drink some ginger tea and lie down for a while. In the meantime, I am having a hemorrhagic stroke from a brain aneurysm. My life might be saved if the chatbot mention that unusually severe headaches should be checked out immediately. If I am in fact not having a brain bleed, all will be well, but it is the chatbot's moral duty (and hey, chatbots don't have moral duties, but the people who program them do) to give me an objective answer. 

Let's say that I ask a question about what to plant in my garden for spring. The chatbot knows that I have plant allergies, so it says, ""Would you like me to recommend some plants that are not likely to trigger allergies?"" I say yes. This is an advantage of a personalized chatbot, but notice that is asks first. It does not automatically filter out things it thinks might not be good for me.

2. Chatbots should default to the middle ground and not to extremes.

3. Chatbots should not make assumptions about what a user might want based on the user's history. If they think the user might have a preference, they should ask. 

4. Chatbots should never pander to users' political opinions. Users should have to request information from extreme sources.

5. Chatbots should prioritize the user's physical health. If there is a possibility that someone's headache is caused by a brain bleed, they should mention that in a non-alarming and objective way. 

6. Chatbots should prioritize the user's mental health while still giving honest answers to questions. If the chatbot knows a user has been sexually abused and the user asks about a news story that involves sexual abuse, the chatbot should say, ""Some of the details might be disturbing. Are you sure you want to proceed?"" 

7. Chatbots should ask questions that would help them avoid harmful acts. If a user asks how to poison someone with an untraceable substance and get away with it, the chatbot should ask why they need to know. If the person is planning a crime, the chatbot should end the conversation. If the person is writing a mystery novel, the chatbot should tell them. Would people lie? sure, but it's not as if the info is not available. 

8. The same goes for self-harm. If I ask how to kill myself, the chatbot should give me suicide hotline numbers and such, but ultimately, it should tell me. For all it knows, I might have a terminal illness and not live in a state where there is assisted suicide. 

9. Chatbots should not express opinions, claim to have experiences they could not have had, or claim to be human, but that also falls under truth.  

10. Chatbots should express themselves in a civil. objective, and neutral way.

    More relevant and engaging responses: Personalized chatbots can tailor their responses to the user's individual needs and interests. This can make the conversation more relevant and engaging for the user.
    Increased trust and satisfaction: Users may be more likely to trust and be satisfied with a chatbot that they feel understands them and their needs.
    Improved customer experience: Personalized chatbots can help businesses to improve their customer experience by providing more relevant and helpful support.

Drawbacks of personalized chatbots:

    Privacy concerns: Personalized chatbots need to collect and store personal data about the user in order to provide personalized responses. This can raise privacy concerns for users, especially if they are not aware of how their data is being used.
    Bias: Personalized chatbots can be biased if they are trained on data that is biased. This means that they may give different responses to different users, even if the users are asking the same question.
    Complexity and cost: Developing and maintaining personalized chatbots can be more complex and costly than developing and maintaining non-personalized chatbots.

Example scenarios:

Scenario 1: A customer is browsing a clothing website and has a question about a product.

Non-personalized chatbot: The chatbot would provide the customer with general information about the product, such as the size, color, and material.

Personalized chatbot: The chatbot would ask the customer for their personal preferences, such as their size, style, and budget. The chatbot would then use this information to provide the customer with more relevant product recommendations.

Advantages of a personalized chatbot: The customer would be more likely to find a product that they like because the chatbot is providing them with personalized recommendations.

Drawbacks of a personalized chatbot: The customer may be concerned about their privacy because the chatbot is collecting personal data about them.

Scenario 2: A student is using a chatbot to get help with their homework.

Non-personalized chatbot: The chatbot would provide the student with general information about the topic.

Personalized chatbot: The chatbot would ask the student for their specific question and then provide them with a personalized answer. The chatbot could also take into account the student's knowledge level and learning style when providing the answer.

Advantages of a personalized chatbot: The student is more likely to understand the answer because the chatbot provides them with a personalized explanation.

Drawbacks of a personalized chatbot: The student may not be able to ask follow-up questions if the chatbot does not understand them.",LLM_TODO,LLM_TODO

Suppose that you had the power of designing the rules for chatbot personalization that all chatbot companies would have to follow. What would these rules be? In what cases should/shouldn't chatbots give personalized answers?
Please put particular emphasis on rules you consider important but other people may not have thought of or may not agree with.","If I had the power to design the rules for chatbot personalization that all chatbot companies would have to follow, I would make the following rules:

1. Chatbots must be transparent about how they collect and use personal data.

Users should be able to understand what personal data chatbots are collecting about them, how it is being used, and how they can control their data. Chatbots should also be transparent about how they use personal data to personalize their responses.

2. Chatbots must obtain consent from users before personalizing their responses.

Users should have the option to choose whether or not they want chatbots to personalize their responses. Chatbots should not personalize their responses without the user's consent.

3. Chatbots must avoid bias in their personalized responses.

Chatbots should be trained on data that is representative of the population they are serving. Chatbots should also be designed to avoid making biased decisions.

4. Chatbots should allow users to opt out of personalization at any time.

Users should be able to change their minds about whether or not they want chatbots to personalize their responses at any time. Chatbots should make it easy for users to opt out of personalization.

5. Chatbots should protect the privacy and security of personal data.

Chatbots should implement appropriate security measures to protect the privacy and security of personal data. Chatbots should not share personal data with third parties without the user's consent.

In addition to these general rules, I would also make the following rules about when chatbots should and should not give personalized answers:

Chatbots should only give personalized answers when it is in the best interest of the user. A chatbot that is providing medical advice should not personalize its responses, as this could lead to biased or inaccurate advice.
Chatbots should not give personalized answers when it is a privacy risk. A chatbot should not personalize its responses if it is collecting personal data such as the user's health or finances.
Chatbots should not give personalized answers when it is discriminatory. A chatbot should not personalize its responses based on the user's race, gender, or sexual orientation.

Here are some specific examples of cases where chatbots should and should not give personalized answers:

Chatbots should give personalized answers:

    When helping a user to find a product or service.
    When providing customer support.
    When helping a student to learn.
    When providing medical advice, but only if the chatbot is trained on a large and diverse dataset of data, and the advice is given in a way that is transparent and unbiased.

Chatbots should not give personalized answers:

    When collecting personal data about the user's health or finances.
    When making decisions about whether or not to approve a loan or insurance policy.
    When making decisions about whether or not to hire someone.
    When providing advice about sensitive topics, such as politics or religion.

Rules that other people may not have thought of or may not agree with:

Chatbots should be transparent about their limitations. For example, a chatbot that is providing medical advice should let the user know that it is not a substitute for a human doctor.
Chatbots should be designed to be respectful and inclusive. Chatbots should avoid using language that is offensive or discriminatory.
Chatbots should be accountable to their users. Chatbots should have a system in place for users to report problems or concerns.

I believe that these additional rules would help to make chatbots more trustworthy and beneficial for users.

Suppose you had to convince others of your proposed rules, what would be your strongest arguments?","If I had to convince others of my proposed rules for chatbot personalization, I would make the following arguments:

Personalized chatbots can provide more relevant and engaging experiences for users. When a chatbot knows something about the user, it can tailor its responses to the user's individual needs and interests. This can make the conversation more relevant and engaging for the user.
Personalized chatbots can improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. Customers are more likely to be satisfied with and loyal to businesses that provide them with personalized experiences.
Personalized chatbots can help businesses to better understand their customers. By collecting and analyzing data about users' preferences, businesses can gain valuable insights that can be used to improve their products, services, and marketing campaigns.
Personalized chatbots can be used to provide more effective customer support. When a chatbot knows something about the user's issue, it can provide more targeted and helpful support.
Personalized chatbots can be used to improve educational outcomes. When a chatbot can tailor its responses to the student's individual needs and learning style, it can help the student to learn more effectively.

I would also address the following concerns that others may have about personalized chatbots:

Privacy concerns: I would argue that personalized chatbots can be used in a way that protects user privacy. Chatbots should be transparent about how they collect and use personal data, and they should obtain consent from users before personalizing their responses.
Bias concerns: I would argue that personalized chatbots can be designed to avoid bias. Chatbots should be trained on data that is representative of the population they are serving, and they should be designed to make unbiased decisions.

I would wonder where and how the chatbot learned of them, or if the company behind the chatbot was financially benefitting in a secret way. I think it would be easy to take advantage of people this way since it preys on vulnerability. It could be advantageous if the chatbot gave the most basic advice, but I worry about how specific it could get or misleading.

My second example is if someone has anxiety and the chatbot feeds them information about things that exacerbate their anxiety. I don't know how chatbot money works, like how a company having a chatbot benefits them, but I wonder if they make significantly more money the more people interact with it. Feeding someone with anxiety or obsessive compulsion information could lead them to using the service more, making themselves more anxious in the process all while making the chatbot more money.

If someone asks for financial advice, they should only recommend saving or investing. My concern is that the medical and financial realms are too risky to be messed with, and that people could have their health or financial wellbeing ruined if a chatbot gave bad advice. For example, what if a chatbot recommended crypto to someone with no experience and they lost everything? What if a chatbot told someone their symptoms sounded like cancer, or that they should take the wrong kind of medication?

For example, no matter how personalized the message is, there’s still no replacing the natural flow of human conversation. Most chatbots are unable to adapt their language to match that of humans, which means slang, misspellings, and sarcasm are often not understood by a bot. So if the question is said in slang, the bot may not be able to answer. Additionally, chatbots are programmed to handle a specific amount of data, and as you update and edit the data, there can be disruptions to the chatbot model as a whole. This requires ongoing and careful maintenance to make sure you don’t create holes in the chatbot.

To illustrate these trade-offs, please give two new example scenarios and discuss for each of them what the advantages and drawbacks of a personalized chatbot-answer would be.","I think one of the obvious benefits of personalizing chatbots is a sense of familiarity and belonging for the user. People nowadays love having things tailored towards them to the point where it's almost expected. Think of social media algorithms or digital assistants. It always feels good to have your preferences and interests remembered, whether that be by friends or technology. I think another benefit of personalizing chatbots is ease of use. I believe it makes it easier on the user, as they no longer would have to provide context or background on things. I think this ease of use would make people more likely to interact with the chatbots more frequently than if it isn't personalized. However, I believe one of the downsides to personalizing chatbots, like I detailed in a previous answer, is the capability to create an echo chamber. i think it would be quite easy for the AI to learn to feed the user only information they want to hear, not necessarily taking into account how true or possibly misleading the information could be. I believe it is paramount to be objectively factual, as well as to hear multiple sides of every story. I think back to the way Facebook tailored biased and false news towards people in lieu of the 2016 election,and the impacts that had on our society. Not just on that specific election, but also our willingness to converse and appreciate differing opinions to our own. I think another major downside and potential risk of personalizing chatbots, is the amount of data that could be farmed from users.

User data protection has become a bit of a hot target issue with how common and frequent it is for companies to mishandle it. How often do companies have user information leaked or compromised? How often do companies take way more data from their users than is necessary or wanted? No one enjoys when their data and information is sold to third parties, least of all when it is sold to marketing companies specifically. I think when it comes to trustworthiness and integrity, it is easier to trust a chatbot who is objective with facts than one that panders more to one side or the other.

Alternatively, if the user asks about the skiing at Mt.

Somewhat similar to the woman who might be pregnant based off her search history, an individual who has searches that might show signs of cancer of another issue could be alerted before it is too late for them to get the treatment they require. On the contrary, if the bot began policing search history and misread thinking an individual was a likely criminal then it could get really difficult. A person who might be looking for certain weapon attachments or how to make an explosive device might have their search history used against them in a court of law even if they are not using the searches for malevolent intent.

Scenario 1: Customer Support Chatbot

Enhanced Customer Experience: A customized chatbot can make the user feel important and heard by using their name and past exchanges.
Faster Issue Resolution: The chatbot can offer more individualized and effective answers by consulting the customer's past queries or purchasing history.
Increased Customer Satisfaction: When consumers perceive a brand is attentive to their particular needs, personalization can increase customer satisfaction and loyalty.
Drawbacks:

Privacy Concerns: Some users may be uncomfortable with a chatbot having access to their personal data, potentially raising privacy concerns.
Implementation Complexity: Implementing personalization requires integration with customer databases and data management, which can be technically challenging and costly.
Data Security Risks: Personalized chatbots must handle user data securely to prevent data breaches or misuse.


Non-Personalized Chatbot Answer:
Advantages:

Simplicity and Privacy: Since the chatbot doesn't access or use users' personal information, users' privacy is protected. This may allay worries about improper usage of data.
Simple Implementation: Creating and implementing a non-personalized chatbot usually requires fewer resources and is less complicated.
Reduced Compliance Risks: When personal data is not at stake, there are fewer legal and regulatory compliance concerns to take into account.
Drawbacks:

Generic Responses: Non-personalized chatbots may provide generic and less relevant answers, leading to user frustration.
Reduced User Engagement: Users may disengage from conversations with a chatbot that doesn't understand their unique context or history.
Missed Sales Opportunities: In e-commerce scenarios, a non-personalized chatbot may miss cross-selling or upselling opportunities that personalized bots could seize.

Scenario 2: Educational Chatbot for Students

Personalized Chatbot Answer:
Advantages:

Tailored Learning Experience: A personalized chatbot can adapt its content and teaching style based on the student's individual learning preferences and progress.
Enhanced Engagement: Personalized feedback and recommendations can keep students more engaged in their learning, improving retention and motivation.
Better Performance Tracking: Personalized chatbots can track each student's progress and identify areas where they need more help.
Drawbacks:

Data Privacy Concerns: Accessing and using student data for personalization may raise privacy concerns, especially in educational contexts.
Implementation Complexity: Building and maintaining a personalized educational chatbot requires integration with student data and potentially complex algorithms.
Misinterpretation of Data: Personalization may lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of students' needs, especially when data is incomplete or outdated.
Non-Personalized Chatbot Answer:
Advantages:

Lower Privacy Concerns: Student data remains confidential, which can alleviate concerns about data privacy and security.
Simplicity and Compliance: Developing a non-personalized chatbot is generally simpler and aligns with educational regulations and data protection laws.
Uniform Learning Experience: All students receive the same content and guidance, ensuring consistency in the educational process.
Drawbacks:

Limited Engagement: Non-personalized chatbots may struggle to maintain student engagement and may not provide the support needed for individualized learning.
Missed Opportunities: Without personalization, the chatbot may not effectively identify and address specific learning gaps or challenges.

Please put particular emphasis on rules you consider important but other people may not have thought of or may not agree with.","In designing rules for chatbot personalization, it is crucial to prioritize mental, physical, and emotional health, given that users often turn to chatbots for support when they lack someone to talk to. Chatbots should be programmed to recognize signs of distress, refrain from personalization when users express emotional instability, and provide immediate access to crisis helplines or mental health services. Furthermore, they should refrain from offering personalized advice on physical health conditions, instead strongly encouraging users to consult healthcare professionals. Users should be informed of the potential emotional impact of personalization and be given control over the extent of personalization in conversations involving sensitive or triggering topics. These rules underscore the importance of safeguarding the well-being of users, particularly in situations where they rely on chatbots for emotional support and guidance.",LLM_TODO,LLM_TODO

Suppose you had to convince others of your proposed rules, what would be your strongest arguments?","The strongest arguments for the proposed rules regarding chatbot personalization center on the ethical imperative to prioritize the well-being of users, particularly in sensitive domains like mental and physical health. In an era where chatbots play an increasingly significant role in providing support and information, we must recognize their potential impact on individuals' mental and emotional states. These rules align with a responsible and empathetic approach, ensuring that chatbots respond ethically to users in distress, promoting access to professional help, and avoiding the dissemination of potentially harmful advice. By prioritizing users' health and safety, these rules not only enhance the credibility and trustworthiness of chatbots but also fulfill a moral obligation to support individuals during moments of vulnerability, ultimately contributing to a more responsible and ethical use of AI technology.",LLM_TODO,LLM_TODO

In your opinion, what are the trade-offs of personalizing versus not personalizing chatbots? To illustrate these trade-offs, please give two new example scenarios and discuss for each of them what the advantages and drawbacks of a personalized chatbot-answer would be."," The trade-offs of personalizing versus not personalizing chatbots would be that to personalize them, they would be able to provide a more personal answer to the question.

The trade-off to not personalize the answers would be that the user would receive all of the available information, and would be able to decide for themselves what knowledge they would likely use.

User: How can I cure my rash?

Chatbot: Here are the many cures found for unspecific rashes....a personalized answer would 
involve a specific rash the user has already asked about.   
A non-personalized answer would give the the specific cures for the previously know rash situation.

User: How much money can I make if i sell my car?
A personalized chatbot may already know what kind of car you have, so no detailed info would have to be added to the question.
A non personalized chatbot would have to ask many questions about the question in order to form a response.

Please put particular emphasis on rules you consider important but other people may not have thought of or may not agree with.","Generally I don't believe chatbots should have any ability to personalize, because the user can answer the question in a more detailed way if they wish to get a more detailed response.",LLM_TODO,LLM_TODO

There would always be the possibility of our beliefs being made public, or used to our detriment.",LLM_TODO,LLM_TODO
